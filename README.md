# Software-Engineering-1-Course-Projects

This repository contains the Computer Assignments of Software-Engineering-1-Course implemented with Java @ ECE, University of Tehran, Spring 2024.

- Assignment 4: Minimum Execution Quantity
- Assignment 5: Stop Limit Order
- Assignment 6: Technical Debt
- Assignment 7: Auction Matching
- Assignment 8: Code Smells & Improving Design

## Note:

The first 4 projects are done individually and the rest are done in groups of 3 (SeyedMahdi HajiSeyedHossein, Alireza Hosseini, Amirali Shahriary). Here you can see group projects of TinyMe.

## [Assignment 4: Minimum Execution Quantity](https://github.com/matahho/TinyME/tree/MEQ-field)



In this assignment, we were supposed to add a simple feature to the `TinyME` application. The feature was to add a minimum execution quantity to the orders. The feature was supposed to be implemented in a way that the existing tests would not fail. This feature shows that an order will be moved into the order book only if the quantity of the order is greater than or equal to the minimum execution quantity.

## [Assignment 5: Stop Limit Order](https://github.com/matahho/TinyME/tree/StopLimitOrder)


In this assignment, we were supposed to add a new type of order to the `TinyME` application. The new order type is called `Stop Limit Order`.

## [Assignment 6: Technical Debt](https://github.com/matahho/TinyME/tree/techDebt)

In this assignment, we were supposed to refactor the `TinyME` application to remove the technical debt, since the last version of the application was not well-designed. The technical debt was supposed to be removed in a way that the existing tests would not fail.

## [Assignment 7: Auction Matching](https://github.com/matahho/TinyME/tree/auction)


In this assignment, we were supposed to add a new feature to the `TinyME` application. The new feature was to add an auction mechanism to the application.

## [Assignment 8: Code Smells & Improving Design](https://github.com/matahho/TinyME/tree/smells)


In this assignment, we were supposed to improve the design of the `TinyME` application. The design was supposed to be improved in a way that the existing tests would not fail.
